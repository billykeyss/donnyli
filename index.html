If I see someone driving down the street in a GTR I think he must be doing something right with his to be able to afford one of those right?</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post21text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post21text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; However, if we look a little deeper, the most successful people in the world aren't in it for the money. They are just constantly pushing their own limits and striving to be the best at what they do, monetary success just happened to be a byproduct I think it took me quite a while to come to this realization, and by quite I mean the last twenty years of my life.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; In my childhood days, I always dreamed of becoming a doctor and the only reason was because I knew they earned a ridiculous amount of money, however when highschool was about to finish and my study habits went to shit, I sub consciously told myself I wasn't ambitious nor smart enough to do it and I kinda chickened out. In retrospect, I realize they might not have been such a bad idea for right now I have come across many great learning opportunities in the coop program at Waterloo. Although I am not a big fan of the current program I am in and some of the work I am doing as a result, I am thankful for the opportunities that have been presented to me.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; In my current job, all I do is pretty much send out quotes. These quotes range from a couple grand to a couple hundred thousand grand. So even though I don't spend my days constantly pushing myself, I have learned skills like attention to detail, organization and prioritization.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; For every quote we send out, the bill of material must reflect exactly what the engineer has designed or else the competition can easily push up aside by saying we did not meet the spec in a certain way. In order to do this, I've got to dig through pages of drawings and spec and read through every detail to make sure I am not missing anything in my quotes. The relevance of this is that this skill will pour over into the other aspects of my life such as proof reading my work, being confident about what we are saying before we say it and just being able to zoom in on the details of life in general.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Secondly, when I am quoting over a hundred jobs a month I have to learn to organize and prioritize. For every time I get a job, I get an initial closing date, this I must evaluate the size of the jobs and organize and prioritize my time to get all my Job's done in an efficient manner.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; So how this relate this to success? I think that through all these life lessons and learning opportunities that have been presented to me, I will eventually be able to find and cultivate a passion for which I will wake up for everyday. And through the pursuit of such, I will be able to deem myself successful regardless of my monetary gains</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post20" id="post20"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post20">Hustle and Reflect</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>April 7 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; So I have been on a little spree of Tim Ferris' podcasts. As I've said before he interviews famous people of all areas of work. What I really enjoy about these podcasts is that he gets really personal with the people he interviews and breaks down their life journey, their habits of success, and overall the podcast is done in a casual tone.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post20text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post20text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; Today I came across his interview with Jamie Foxx which on the note of "hustle and reflect". That is how Jamie Foxx lives his life. These couple of words will be the main focus of this post.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;"If life gives you gold. Take it. If life doesn't give you gold. Take it" I think I came across this quote on a tattoo artist' instagram. I think this quote really builds on the quote of "when life gives you lemons..." To me, this quote means that not only should we be grateful of the good fortunes that we come across in life, but we must also work for them. This is the idea of hustling. Jamie Foxx said that if we focus more on getting the important work done in our lives then we will have less time to worry about all the things we should be doing. I think is a really good perspective on the idea of productivity. Sometimes, when we stop and think about how much work we have to do, we get so overwhelmed and anxious with just the thought of all these work that nothing actually gets done. I do this about... 200 times a day? But if we just dive straight into to our work then our minds will be too busy on actually getting each task on our list done than to sit there and worry. You gotta hustle for what you want out of life, because if we are constantly improving ourselves than we are regressing. That is what I believe at least. And I can definitely provide some concrete examples of this. For me, the transition between school and work term always just destroys my workout routines. I spend the week or two that I have off either traveling, partying, or just full on relaxing, and my return to the gym after sucks. My body forgets what its like to be constantly pushing my muscles to such high intensities and after a couple sets of a one plate bench, my chest will be sore for the next week. But since I have developed such a habit of going into the gym, it is fairly easy to get my rhythm back and get my hustle on. After a mere couple of weeks, I will be back to my usual bench. To me, life isn't about constantly moving forward, but more of taking five steps forward and one step back. The hustle is not to take those first five steps, but after that one backwards step, we are able to pick ourselves back up and keep pushing forward.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Like a yin yang, I believe life is about balance, so what the yang to the hustle you ask? Reflection. Every day we push ourselves to the limit and everyday we grow a little bit and just like how one must rest in order for his muscles to grow stronger, one must reflect each day in order for themselves to full grow. If we are constantly pushing ourselves, then there must be time for us to rest our minds, our body, and our spirits. I think reflection on our daily lives is very similar to sleeping in order to recover our teared up muscles. If we do not recover and we just keep on pushing, we may lose our focus and start to wear ourselves out. Now when I say reflection, it doesn't necessarily mean to meditate or anything, but rather we should always take a little bit of time at the end of each day to ourselves. To become in tune with our body and mind. To become just a little bit more aware of the actions and results we have taken on each day and to see how they have affected ourselves. What I have learned from meditating is that we should not repress or hold on to good or bad thoughts but to just be aware of them. Acknowledge them and see how each good or bad things that has happened to us each day has affected us in one way or another. And that is how I think we should reflect. If you find yourself stressed out or always in a rush, I really do suggest trying the Headspace app! It only takes 10 minutes of your day and I have felt great results from it!</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post19" id="post19"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post19">Sleeping Less</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>April 6 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;So I've heard and have been told that one does not really need anymore more than 6 hours of sleep a day. I am assuming this is 6 solid hours of sleep a day, which depending on a person might may or may not actually be 6 hours itself. So I am slowly trying to reach this myself, right now I am going to bed by 11:30pm and waking up at 7am. It's only been half a week of this and I am starting to feel... Well, not very rested. However, I have learned that good habits are not a sprint but a marathon and trying to make changes in your life is exciting but always tough at first. So I guess this post is just a reminder to myself to drudge through the drudgery and... Sleep less? Hopefully my body will adjust to this and I won't be sick by the time I leave for Thailand...</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post19text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post19text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; Anyways, some quick thoughts I wanted to share today: So we've all seen TV shows and movies about time travel, seeing the future, predicting the future, etc. So the fundamental question that all these shows relate to in my opinion is a philosophical battle between free will and determism. Let's imagine that we can see into the future and tomorrow we are going to miss the morning bus and be late to work per say. Now we realize this is going to happen, so we do all that we can and prepare ourselves in order to not miss the bus, but what if in the end it is these actions that lead us to this inevitable outcome as if it was pre determined? Then this leads to the question of do we really have free will?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I am not too sure on which side of the fence I stand on for this question yet for I am but a curious mind. I mean, these questions are always worth thinking about, but eventually, our minds get caught up in a mix of jumbled thoughts and when things get too confusing we get a headache and decide to move on with the rest of our lives. But all the while, every time our minds come back to this question, I can safely say that my approach to the answer will have always been altered due to the events that have occurred in my life between the times when I have pondered such things.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;So I guess you can tell that there wasn't much point or focus to this post... And the fact of the matter is, I really didn't want to write today (I even turned off my laptop) so thus I am sitting on the floor typing frantically on my phone to maintain this habit of writing everyday. Some days I just have a lot of thoughts to share and my mind remains somewhat clear for me to focus on a topic to write about but other days such as today, I am tired and my mind feel worn out, and this is the result...</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; So I will leave you today with a problem that I've heard on an interview with Eric Weinstein: So we have umbrella and it really doesn't do what it was designed to do. When it gets rainy, the umbrella top gets blown again and crumbled up. When it's raining at an angle, our legs always get soaked. So mechanical fix can we provide to such a simple design to make do what it was originally designed to do?</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post18" id="post18"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post18">Commitment</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>April 5 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; So lets talk about this very apparent trait of mine: non-attachment. I was going to call it a weakness at first but I thought I would hold up on placing this trait into such a category before taking a step back and really looking at the effect it has had on my life. A lot of my friends tell me I don't have any emotions... (Haha... I have a lot!) I am just not very good at emanating them.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post18text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post18text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; Up until this moment in time, I still have zero fucking clue what I want to do. Currently I am halfway through getting a degree in Geological Engineering, and I've work jobs from selling Telus to quoting $200k worth of Daikin VRF equipment, I have even devoted a good number of hours of my life to learning about HVAC (this just kind of happened) and I can't truly say I would want to stay in any of these areas of work or study for the rest of my life. I mean, I get through school fine, the classes aren't super hard and I am fairly good at adapting to my work environments. Through my lack of interest, I have learned to become a very flexible and adaptable person. I am always prepared for plans to fall through, for things to not turn out how I want them to be and though I do feel disappointment from such occurrences, I've developed a mental capacity to deal it with. And this mental capacity is called "non-attachment". If I don't put certain feelings towards things in my life like my job, my clothes or my hobbies than if something changes and suddenly I find myself without one or two of these things, I don't really feel a lose. So I think this is a good trait to a certain degree. I don't attach sentiments to the material things in life which makes it very easy to always be going through change and keep my life simple.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; However, there are two sides to everything. So this lack of attachment or interest in everything in life has always led to a inevitable lack of commitment to all the things I do. So here is a question I have been pondering lately: does one lack commitment due to a lack of self interest of the things he/she is pursuing in life or does one lack interest due to the lack of commitment of such things? I have always been an open minded person and a quick learner. Thus I am always excited to try new things out, but when things get tough and I find myself struggling with the unknown, I do have a tendency to just quit. This is pretty apparent with girls. I always liked the idea of the chase, but I never really followed through after that. Was it because I was scared of committing myself or because I simply did not like them enough to try and commit myself? The answer to this question will have to come the day I find myself in a somewhat serious relationship. It is definitely something I want to experience...</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;This lack of commitment has also been pretty apparent in the professional area of my life too. When I was doing sales, I got really good at my job really fast. I was basically put into this corner of "well if I don't make any sales today, I didn't make any money" and combined with my abilities to talk forever, I gathered myself fairly quickly and became one of the top salesmen on my team. However, once I got good, I was just good. I could manage 4-8 sales a day which equaled out to pretty awesome pay, but I could never consistently get out of single digits. Imagine if I made 10-12 sales instead of 4-8 everyday. I would feel like I am on top of the world and I would be making bank. However, going from good to great is a feat much higher than going to OK to good and I never found any interest in getting to that stage. I think a part of me was just comfortable with being good and did not want to take on the risks of those 0 sales days in the short term in order to achieve double digits in the long term. A part of the reason for this was that these co-op terms are only 4 months... I guess that last sentence was more of an excuse I made for myself more than anything else. But you get my point right?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I think is non-attachment does have its benefits in my life, but it has been doing me a lot of harm and I really need to work on sorting my commitment issues out by taking those leaps of faith. From what I've learned as a salesman, it doesn't matter how many times we fail, as long as we keep pushing until we have reached success. Through this, not only do we get to truly taste the glory of success, but also learn about our own strengths and weaknesses along the way.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post17" id="post17"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post17">Drudging on</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>April 4 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; I am running out of things to write about... It's great to be able to get my thoughts out everyday and to share my perspectives on life, but I do seem to be running out of steam... So this post won't really have any focus but rather me writing out whatever comes to mind.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; So I've been listening to Tim Ferris' radio show... Yes I know, another podcast... and the episode I landed on in the last couple of days was an interview of Cal Fussman, who the fuck is that? I even googled imaged this dude and go about as many pictures of him as I would get if I were to google image myself. Moving on from that, Cal Fussman is considered to be a master interviewer, he talks about his 10 years of traveling the world, his fight against a world famous feather weight boxer, and how he managed to interview people like Muhammad Ali to Robert DeNiro.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post17text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post17text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;The reason I like Tim Ferris' podcast is that he tries to breakdown every interviewee's goals, habits and stories and he doesn't just limit himself to a certain genre of famous people, but anyone would is considered famous. (He has even interviewed Kaskade!) So Cal Fussman is a famous journalist, but what's really cool about Fussman himself is that he has really developed the art of asking the right questions. So have you ever noticed every time you meet someone you make the same kind of small talk with them? And if sooner or later, you find an area of common interest than the conversation depends, a sense of trust develops and you start to form a bond with this person. But what if you only have 5 minutes to get to this point? Would you still be asking same old boring small talk questions? I would certainly hope not.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; So how do we avoid this small talk? Fussman talks about himself learning to ask the right questions. Questions that would catch the other person off guard. Once he got on a train, sat beside an only Hungarian (I think?) woman and asked her about a certain food she made. Now in his case, he got on this train with no money, no end destination and his goal was to find a place to sleep at the end of the night, so by asking a question like this, he provoked the woman enough to allow her to share with him a prideful story of her masterful cooking skills, and with so much pride on the line, she ended up inviting him over to try to try wonderful dish. I realize this story was very vague in details, but if you really want to hear the rest then I suggest you check out this wonderful interview!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;So with this story in mind, Fussman points to the idea that a great question is one that should intrigue the interviewee about the interviewer enough to find trust and to able to share a deep and worth while story to him. With this, you can skip all the small talk and let the person demonstrate their own interests, beliefs and values just by actively listening to the story he/she is sharing with you and then building upon such stories with that of your own experiences. This way, you can build a relationship over a short period of time and quickly learn the art of interviewing.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; So I most listen to these podcasts out of enjoyment and most of the time, I do end up retaining a certain thing or two about the lifestyles of these famous people that I try to implement into my own life oneway or another.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post16" id="post16"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post16">Perspective ver 2.0</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>April 3 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; I think that we should always be re-evaluating our perspective on life and the people around us, because after a while we start to become comfortable with life. Now comfortable might sound good at first, but what I've come to learn (still working on the applying it to real life part) is that being comfortable is something you should be avoiding at all times. My manager at Telus in the summer drilled that into our heads on every single morning meeting we had, and I believed him. Why? Because he just past his late twenties and he was achieving his own life goals. All it takes for me to believe in what you are saying is if you believe in what you are saying.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post16text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post16text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; One thing for me that has changed is that I used to always be jealous of people who where around the same age as me but they were better than me at stuff, and this ranges from school to relationships to even the bench press. In the last couple of months though, I've learned to take a different perspective on things. Nowadays, I remind myself that everything can be learned. Prove me wrong. I've sold people Telus from literally knowing nothing about sales. I think this is a really good mentality to take on. Now rather than feeling inferior to other people, I have learned to appreciate all my own strengths and to see these people as a shortcut to success, I mean if they are smarter than me in school, they must be doing things differently than me and if I can learn from them and implement their strategies into my own life than surely I will be able to reflect those same results.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;However with that in mind, I want to mention that we shouldn't be following these rules word for word. When a chef learns to cook he first follows recipes in order to build a foundation for his cooking skills, but once he has solidified his own foundation, he must take all that he has learned and being in a creative processing of building in his own way and that is how he will flourish as an original cook. I am not sure if this was the best analogy, but the point I am trying to make here is that sure we can always follow other people's good habits and try to mimic what they do, but we will not always yield the same results as them. Personally, I think following other people's ideologies and life choices are a great start when we have no idea where to go ourselves, but once we have understood the theory behind such ideologies we must learn to tweak and mold them to fit our own lives. This way, not only does following other people's ideas allow us to easily develop a good habit into our own lives, but after this good habit has been solidified into our own minds, we can change things around in order to make things more efficient for ourselves.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Hmm... I think this took a different turn than the initial point I was trying to make at the start of this post, but at this point I think quantity is better than quality. My primary focus is to develop a daily habit of writing, and I think once I have established that, I will switch my focus onto clear defined and concise posts!</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post15" id="post15"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post15">Needs. Wants. Likes</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>April 2 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; Isn't it weird how there is always something on our wish-list? Whether its a brand new laptop so we can final play Crysis on more than 5 fps or a new pair of earbuds because ours are only "ok". Why is it that we have all these materialistic possessions but we still want more? To be honest I have no idea... and I am attempting to find a solution to it. Everyone says we will be better off with less stuff and that we should simplify our lives, but nowadays, its much easier said than done. For me at least. I don't think consumption is inherently bad, I just we should learn to control our urges and practice the art of mindful consumption. I mean so what if we buy ourselves a new pair of headphones once or twice a year?</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post15text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post15text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;If we've been working hard and think we deserve a reward for it, why not? Now don't take me the wrong way, this doesn't mean every time we have the urge to buy something we think about all the hard work we've done and reason it out to be a reward. We just have to be in careful in differentiating our likes, wants and needs. If we need it (groceries, shampoo, tooth paste) then there should be no hesitation to buy it. The one thing I really dislike is when people say they only buy things on sale. That's complete bullshit to me, but hey if that helps you sleep better at night, I am not one to judge. On to our wants, this category contains things that would add value to our lives, but not having them doesn't reduce any value in our lives either. Since I'm a gym rat, I think wants to me are supplements, having them does help me reach my daily nutrient goals easily but not having them doesn't have a major impact in my life. For wants however, we must set restrictions or rules on them, or else they can start to consume our lives. Likes are very easy to define for myself. I was just looking to get a new pair of headphones before writing this and things like "noise canceling, bass, durability" all that really helps sell the product and makes me really want a pair, but I don't need them, they would be nice to have, but they wouldn't be adding anymore value in my life. Sure my headphones right now sometimes turn the volume down randomly, or restart the song 15 times before they start working properly, but past those small bugs, they work great! They do exactly what they are supposed to do and that's all I need. So a new pair of headphones would save me some frustration and maybe increase the sound quality of my music, but I really couldn't give two fucks about that.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Mindfulness seems to be the theme of the month for me. Every podcast I've been listening to and every book I've read in the past couple of weeks says that in our to find fulfillment in our lives, one must live out a mindful life. I think that all this has really done good for me in a sense where my life isn't as focused on financial satisfaction but rather on physical, emotional and spiritual satisfaction. At the start of this term, my head was definitely geared towards the amount of money I was making and the amount of things I could buy as result, and after almost not being able to pay rent for a month (thank you mom and dad...) I realized that i was going a little too HAM on the wrong aspects of my life. Now that doesn't mean I've suddenly became a budget master... I am still pretty bad at controlling my spendings, but that event has made me much more aware of myself which is very beneficial long term, and now I can start working on a strategy to start controlling my savings. So in conclusion to all this, the reason I have been so focused on the idea of mindfulness is that once we become self aware we will be able to identify our strengths and weakness and then slowly implement strategies to overcome our weakness. I mean you don't just go to the gym once and bench two plates... (most people at least)</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post14" id="post14"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post14">Vision</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>April 1 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; So I've got this work term report due on the second Tuesday of school, but I am going to be in Thailand during that time so now I've got to finish it a week before school even starts... doesn't sound that bad right? But that week is in only four weeks... Normally you'd think four weeks is plenty enough to pump out a report, unless you knew nothing about the topic you were going to right about. As incoherent as that may sound, that's about what my current situation looks like, and it sucks. On the bright side, I've finally been able to start digging into the million piece of data given to me and find some leeway on the actually content of my work. Tomorrow I am going to invest a good couple hours of my time and try and make some actual progress. My timeline goes something like this: this weekend I will start digging into the data and get the analysis done by next Friday. Next weekend, I will take the analysis of my work and write out the bulk of the report. The weekend after that I will proof read it, add the finishing touches and have it completed by that Sunday night. That's the plan.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post14text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post14text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; Now I know nothing in life really goes according to plan, but having a framework for my goals is better than nothing right? I mean I will feel demotivated along the way, probably every single day, but knowing that I can finish my report with five days to spare will keep me going. I just have to work hard, have self-discipline and push through the next twenty some days of my life. Those twenty days are going to fucking suck, but the fifteen rewarding days of being half across the world enjoy great scenery, food and spending a huge chunk of time with one of my best friends is a reward I am definnetly willing to put in the hardwork for.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I was going to start of a lot of these sentences with "I hope" instead of "I will" but I've learned in these past couple of weeks that our mental state has a huge effect our daily lives. If we imagine success, put in the work, then success will play out exactly as how we imagined it and it will come as if it was an everyday thing in our lives. Michael Phelps would imagine himself swimming the race routines everyday before he went to bed. He would imagine every single vivid detail down to his every stroke and with the hard work he put in, he Olympic records was just another race routine that played out exactly as how he imagined them in his head. So why is it that we cannot do the same thing in our lives? The answer to that is simply we can. We just have to be willing to let it happen. People often talk about having a view on the cup as half empty or half full, but after reading through "The Monk That Sold His Ferrari", I now view my cup as always empty. Always ready to be filled with new knowledge.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post13" id="post13"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post13">Being Busy</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 31 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; So this writing everyday thing differently did not happen. I am not discouraged though, I mean thats life right? I've got this poster of Mike Tyson that says "everyone thinks they have a plan, until they get punched in the face" and I think that's true. So I forgot to write yesterday, I was take responsibility for it and move on. Sometimes we will make mistakes in life or be caught up in everything around us that we forget to tend to ourselves, but that doesn't mean it's too late. I think the most important part is to become self aware of these events and to purposely learn from your mistakes. There is no point in dwelling on the past but that doesn't mean we should just forget about them. One thing I've learned from this meditation app I've been using (Headspace) is that we should not try to get caught up on our thoughts or try and resist them but rather to be aware of them and if suddenly we catch ourselves being distracted we just need to gently bring our minds back to the present.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post13text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post13text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; I've been meditating for about a month now (10 minutes each day) and I've begun to notice myself becoming more calm overall, more collected. Now this doesn't mean I've become a wise sage, but rather I've learned to be more aware of my present self and my surroundings and that I've started to learn to manage my thoughts. I've always been big about getting exercise and training the body to maintain health, but I've never bought into the idea of training the mind, however since this term is all about self development, I thought I'd give meditation a try. I mean who doesn't have 10 minutes to spare in their day? At first I started to notice that I slept better and then eventually the effect just started wearing off. Not in the sense that I wasn't sleeping well but more of a plateauing effect. The initial burst of change from meditation started to wear off but I push myself through the drudgery. So last night I decided I was going to wake up a little bit earlier this morning, do some push ups to get the blood flowing and meditate for a bit before I got on with my day. Wow! I am not sure if it was the push ups or the meditation, but I really felt awake and energized throughout most of the morning. I went to work, put my phone away and got all my daily tasks done before lunch. It felt great, but by the afternoon, the looming thought of my work term report came and all my energy suddenly fading away. I am not sure if it was my thoughts or the fact that my boss threw me into a very in depth topic without any context that overwhelmed and drained me.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;So regarding this work term report, as if it wasn't hard enough by itself. My boss wants to me analyze a specific function of the HVAC work they we provide to our customers. However, I know literally nothing about our systems other than the costs and the general capacities. And here he wants me to look into the data and figure out how it actually affects the specified functions of the machines itself. What the fuck dude. I spent a whole afternoon reading background info into this stuff and without the help of our engineering supervisor basically mapping out the directions I should take into starting my work term report I didn't actually learn much. This sucks. I am very frustrated, however I've decided that this will do the company good and that I will try my best to work through it. If by next week I've still got nothing to work with. I will ask my boss for help, but I will give this 100% of my effort first and try to figure out all that I can before I rush to my boss for an easy solution.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post12" id="post12"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post12">Reading for days</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 29 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; So I've had a lot of time to myself in the last couple of months and as a result I've had a lot of time to think and reflect. I am not sure what really happened this term but I've suddenly found myself wanting to get better in every single aspect of my life.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post12text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post12text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; The first and most apparent change I've gone through is developing a reading habit. To read anything and everything. Personally I think that there is no aspect of reading that is bad for you. Every time I finish a book, whether its fiction or non fiction, I feel like I've acquired something out of it. This ranges from learning to what really motivates us (Drive - Daniel Pinkman) or to be fascinated by the stories an author can tell (Robert Langdon Series - Dan Brown). However, six books later, I still know that my reading habit is far from great. I've set myself a goal to read at least 20 pages a day and I still cannot say I satisfy that goal everyday. However it has become easier and easier, not only to read the daily min, but to find and prioritize the time to read. I can say that some days I can read a good 50 pages without watching the time but some days I look up at the page numbers every 5 to 10 minutes to see how many more pages I need to go to reach that daily minimum. One thing I've learned from this process is that through developing this habit of reading, I haven't necessarily developed more will power to sit through those bad days but rather the habit loop has started form in my mind and that I actually need less willpower to sit through each session.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;The Minimalists podcast that I've been religiously listening to always talks about living an intentional life and finding a purpose in everything we do. However, the idea of a habit is to make things mindless, this seems kind of contradictory relate one to another right? I think just the opposite. The first interview Dan Harris did on his 10% happier podcast, the interviewee (I forgot her name) said that forming habits is not necessarily a bad thing and that one should learn to be mindfully mindless. I think a good example is that I go to to the gym everyday after work, it's a habit that I don't even hesitate to think about (unless I feel like shit, like today). I mean it takes more conscious effort to stop myself from going to the gym than it does to go. However even though I mindless go to the gym everyday, once I get there I really try to focus on my daily workout goals. This includes things like focusing on my deadlift form, adding an extra 5 pounds to my bench or just mind to muscle workouts. This habit loop allows me to spend my daily will power on focusing on my specific workout rather than spending these points on trying to get myself to the gym. I mean we only have so much willpower pp to use every right? (If you don't get the reference then...sigh, did you even have a child hood?)</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I think overall that through developing this reading habit, it will further pour over into the rest of my life and help me develop other good habits (studying ones) which will really benefit me greatly in the future!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I will end this post on the positive effects of my willingness to change and habit building and leave the negative ones for another post.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post11" id="post11"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post11">Time off</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 28 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; I've heard that people have bad impulse buying habits. I've never really had that problem, however I have bad "lets go out and stay up really really late" habits. And I am very aware that when I get really tired, I get sick, and when I get sick... I get really sick. I think that I am a very in-the-moment type of person. Sometimes that good, I mean, being spontaneous is a plus right? Other times, I just forget to think ahead and end making choices that hurt me in the long run.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post11text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post11text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; The main reason I think this is worth sharing is that sure we all like to relax and have fun, but when we forget about our long term goals, that's when this idea of impulse buying comes in. And impulse buying doesn't have to be money, it can be time, because what is more valuable than time? I think it's good to go out and enjoy yourself on the weekends but one should always have some type of constraints or self-awareness when doing so.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;This is going to be a short post because I feel like shit and I am going to take a hot shower and head to bed.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post10" id="post10"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post10">I am really really tired</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 27 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; As the title states, I went to bed at 6am this morning... and then I woke up at 9am... Although when I first woke up this morning I actually didn't feel too bad, so I thought maybe I'll catch a bus downtown and grab some vitamins, get some reading done and maybe even some work done? Well I got on the bus and dozed off a little which is normal after a big lunch, but when I hoped on the train, put my head down and suddenly I woke up 2 stops further than planned I knew the crash came. I took a deep breath, told myself to enjoy the fresh air and slowly walked to Shoppers, grabbed what I needed and came straight back home and fell asleep. And after a quick phone call with my mom and a super spicy dinner, I am here willing myself to keep this blog updated!</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post10text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post10text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; Before I dive into my scrambled mind of thoughts I just wanted to say how much I really enjoy Kygo's remix of "I See Fire - Ed Sheeran". I am not a huge fan of Kygo, his music is chill, its good, but its nothing amazing in my opinion. However, this song just really sticks to me, I'm not sure what it is about this song, but I highly recommend checking it out if you haven't heard it!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; So I am currently in a crazed phase of listening to podcasts. Since I have a lot of commuting time, I've found myself entranced by these radio shows. I came a podcast called the The Minimalists just a little over a month ago and they really got to me. I felt like I learned a lot from every episode they put out and thus I thought to expand my selection and explore the whole world of radio shows. Currently I am listening to The Minimalists, The Tim Ferris Show, 10% Happier with Dan Harris, The Mind Palace, The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps and Global News Podcast. With the exception of the last two, all these podcasts focus on people who live meaningful and self fulfilling lives. They aren't all rich but they are all successful and happy with their lives and I think that's what makes their podcasts so valuable.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;What really interests me about these podcasts is that after listening to interviews with music artists, famous minimalists, major investors, everyone seems to have different recipes towards a successful life, sometimes these recipes are on opposing axis of each other. I think that goes to show that no one can define success and happiness for you other than yourself. That's something I felt like I've finally started to come to terms with throughout the last couple months of my life. Although impressing other people like your boss, your classmates and your friends can help further your success and achieve temporary happiness, I think the first step is to come to terms with yourself first. I say that easily, but I am still struggling to do it myself. People say you have to define your own strengths and weaknesses first but I don't think you can just jot them down on a sheet of paper and called it a good evaluation of yourself. It is a good starting on the path of awareness but I think the best way to come to terms with yourself is to not just become aware of yourself when you're sitting at home on a Sunday night typing in front of yourself laptop but all the time. If we can start to stay focused on our everyday lives and the tasks that we face presently then I think that's where self-awareness and person growth will really come to show itself in the long run.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;I think that's about as much as thinking my mind can do today. Now back to sleep...</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post9" id="post9"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post9">Another one!</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 24 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; This blogging thing is hard, but thankfully I've got an amazing friend setting up a website for me! At one point in my life I went on CodeAcademy and sifted through their HTML and CSS course, it was all really easy until the end when the course told you to actually build a website from scratch. I was so baffled by how little I actually knew regarding web development when that end page came up I just instantly closed the page... I think about learning to build a website for myself here and there, but I just don't think thats one of my priorities in life right. Shout out to my man Bill for helping me (he's actually doing 99% of the work) developing my website for me! I think it looks pretty good and hopefully we will have most of the bugs and kinks out so I can start posting on my own blog! In which I am still having trouble coming up with a title for...</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post9text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post9text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp; Day two of me trying to write everyday. I've read plenty of articles about habit building and most of them have generally agreed on the 21 day rule. So it takes 21 days to build a habit. That means I am only 19 more posts away from developing an everyday blogging habit right? Actually, I am currently reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and it seems there is a lot more to habit building that just doing something for 21 days.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; We have a habit loop which consists of a cue, a routine and a reward. That's breaking it down to the simplest terms. So for me to build this habit I am going to have to find a cue (ex: 9pm everyday), a routine (blogging) and a reward (emotional satisfaction). Of course when we have disturbances in our habit loops, things hit the fan and most simple habits can break down. Things like stressful days, when a friend comes to visit on a week day, anything out of the ordinary. So I think in the long run, it is not just a matter of 21 days but really a matter of how much do I really want to pursue this passion? In relation to my last post, am i doing it out of fear or love? Its still love right now... and I will try my best to keep it that way!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Not much has changed from yesterday to today. Not sure how I am supposed to go about these everyday blog posts. Considering these two posts, I think I've come to a structure of rambling on some of my thoughts of the day and then slowly returning to a small update on my life. So anyways... I have go to stop going to the fucking grocery store on statuary holidays... I think to myself "wow I get an extra day off, I am going to take of advantage and get my groceries done on that day" without realizing that every else gets that day off too...</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;After such a fail, I spent most of my day reading some articles and books about the Bulgarian Method on training and squatting everyday, which I won't get into detail about until I've actually started on the program. During this time, I also nagged Bill about all the little details about my website which I think looks pretty awesome!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;I hope you deploy those changes soon and post this one for me on time, thanks a million!</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post8" id="post8"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post8">EveryDay</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 24 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; Ok, so today I listened to an interview with Seth Godin. He is a really fucking successful businessman, so why not try to implement some of his ideas into my life? One of his daily habits was writing, blogging specifically. Sure one could journal, but then its very easy to hide things, to privatize your thoughts. However, his argument pro blogging was that it will forever be there, for other people to see. So now whenever I say something, people can call me out on it and its there. Written in stone. (Written in data more like…) I really like this idea. Not only does this coincide with my value of being an open person, it also allows me to be more accountable with everything in my life.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post8text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post8text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;So now I am going to provide daily blogs which hopefully contains just a little bit of insight towards my life and the things I learn everyday.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Firstly, small rant, work today suck. My co workers are douche bags. If you are going to call me out for scrolling through the internet in front of the whole contracting team (only 3 people… LOL) that’s fine. It was my bad, I shouldn’t have been slacking off during work. BUT if you’re always on reddit and facebook and stay late because your day wasn’t productive, I hope your conscious sits well for calling me out today.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Moving on, I recently also listened to an interview with Charles Poliquin (considered one of the best strength coaches in the world! No exaggeration) and he said something that really stuck with me: “we either make choices out of fear or out of love”. I always believed that the world wasn’t black and white but more a colour spectrum. You now there’s mild, medium, spicy, really spicy, brown people spicy (HAHA I just couldn’t stop myself there). After this quote, I think my outlook on the world has been dented and if you really think about it, if we break down out our own choices is there really anything we chose that is in-between fear or love? I go to the gym because I love working out and seeing results, I study because I fear the idea of failing, I don’t ask the cute girl sitting next to me out to coffee because I fear the idea of getting rejected?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I think becoming aware of this we can really change the way we think. Instead of not asking her out fearing rejection, one could think of this as I’d love to ask her out because I love the idea of meeting new people. Doesn’t that seem like a much better way to approach things? I am going to end this blog on this note: we should all make decisions based out of love and not fear. This will lead to a much more fulfilling life.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post7" id="post7"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post7">Distractions</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 20 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; Ultra is streaming, although I can’t say I am a fan of watching a stream of live raves but PENDULUM AND KNIFE PARTY. That is fucking awesome. However, I am also trying to update this blog and this stream is really (REALLY) distracting.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post7text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post7text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;There was a point when I was tripping on shrooms that I just wanted just felt so overwhelmed by all the stimulus around me and I just wanted to turn everything off and relax. Now that I’m not on shrooms I find myself always wanting to do something, to listen to music, to watch a TV show, read an article, just something to fill my time. Oh the irony of life. Why is it that we have to find ourselves being distracted by something all the time? I think its because life is stressful and these distractions offer us escape, denial from our current realities of life. But they don’t last forever so why not just face it head on?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; It’s been a slow week, so I guess this post will just focus on a couple thoughts I’ve had about life. I used to have a lot of free time on my hands, I would just get baked, play league or watch some TV. That was a terrible time in my life, and sadly that was life a couple months ago. I’m not saying I don’t do it anymore, it’s fun and relaxing but now I am much more deliberate about it. Planning out a Friday night after 8pm to get baked and play some videos isn’t as bad as getting home and doing it right away, I mean it’s a Friday night?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Another point I wanted to make about this was that where the fuck did all my free time go? I didn’t do shit last school term and now I barely have time to finish a 40min TV show or to do everything I want to do. I guess that’s very naïve of me to say that. I may I have less time now, but I can definitely prioritize and get the things I really wanted to do done. But being productive is really hard. I mean I can barely write this blog without alt-tabbing to the ultra stream… (this set is hella good though).</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Living by myself, I’ve suddenly developed all these interests: strength training, reading, photography and blogging, and I know I can’t develop all of these interests at the same time, but the 20-year-old of me thinks I can. I mean, when we are 20 we are on top of the world right? I find myself trying sometimes, and suddenly I just feel overwhelmed and end up watching TV… Productivity in a nut shell, right? Right?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I really need to working on buckling down and learning to be self-disciplined. This week I am going to take one baby step towards that and say I am going to enjoy finishing The Power of Habits (the book I am currently reading) by 9pm on Sunday night. Hopefully, I’ll be able to steal one of my friend’s books to read after while I await the arrival of April or order my new batch of books!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Alright… back to ultra…</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post6" id="post6"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post6">Perspective</a></h2><p>“Compliance will get you through the day, but only engagement will get you through the night”</p></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 14 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; When you’ve only written five blog posts and your friend texts you about the sixth one you’ve been pushing off. That’s a good feeling. I’ve been reading a book called “Drive” by Daniel Pinkman which takes a new perspective on what really motivates us and a lot of it has been centered around accountability and autonomy. Our own willingness to get a job done and a job done well. With that thought in mind, knowing you have friends to keep you accountable for your passions and goals in life really does motivate you to better yourself in every aspect..</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post6text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post6text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;I’m currently half way through the book and a quote I found that really hit me went something like this: “compliance will get you through the day, but only engagement will get you through the night” I think this quote really sums up what I’ve got from this book and puts one’s view on life into perspective.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Wow when I re-read my own shitty explanation of such a meaningful quote, I now fully understand why I got such terrible marks in my English essays… that and my terrible (but improving) grammar…</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Anyways! I spent the weekend in Kingston. To break it down, I spent the weekend drinking, eating and sleeping at a 70/20/10 ratio I would say. I drank a lot… and I definitely paid for it by nothing getting any done yesterday or today. On my bus ride back to Toronto, I really thought about how unproductive I was that weekend and how much work could have been done and I really did feel regretful. However, after a long and not-so-busy work day, I came to realize how much fun I had too. We just have to fully engage ourselves in the moment, whether it might be work or getting that last shot in in beer pong. Real life is hard, it’s stressful and I have learned that turning off is not an option, but rather we just have to focus on one thing at a time and so what if that’s a whole weekend. I mean 72 hours seems like a lot, but that’s also only 0.008th of a year. So it’s all about putting things into perspective and trying to get the most out of each moment. I’ve come to realize that not all these moments are going to be good moments, but I’ve also come to realize that if you fully engage yourself into what you do, you will always come out a little better before, I mean what is there really motivation that’s better than self-improvement?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; P.S. My original title was “the little things” but seeing how much I used the word “perspective” I might as well right?</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post5" id="post5"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post5">Reflection</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 6 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;Another week has ended and here I am again. Not sure where to start for this blog, so lets just write and see where I end up.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post5text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post5text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Shrooms! Every time I do them, a mere six-hour trip seems like a whole other lifetime to me. These drugs really make lose a sense of time. I stare at a clock, I realize what time it is, then the clock starts swirling and a billion other thoughts explode into my head. Next thing you know, I decide to stare at the clock again, I see the numbers in front of me but the amount of time that’s passed by doesn’t register. A billion more thoughts rush back into my head and I looked up to see that I am in a room full of paintings. Surprise! Personally, shrooms really amplify everything around me, whether I am more aware or I am imaging myself to be more aware I notice myself thinking about everything. I pick up on the conversations around me, people’s facial features, people’s tones and even their body language. It’s a weird thought. Also everything moves around me, literally everything. So maybe its just my confused sense that putting all these thoughts in my head and I am not really picking up on anything around me. I mean I forgot about the concept of eating for a whole 4 hours. I saw my friends getting a crepe and they even fed me a bite, but none of that registered. Everything I saw just seemed like a car driving past me, you watched it come in view, observed the details of the car during the moments it resided in front of you and then watched it drive away without ever giving it a second though. What a drug eh?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; With that being said, the lack of sense of time really likes you ponder everything in your life, every small detail from existentialism thoughts to “wow how cool is that painting in front of me?”. Its reflection in a sense, and reflecting back on the last months of this co-op term I’ve really be made aware of my own flaws more than anything else. My lack of self-control, lack of focus, lack of attention to detail and shitty work ethic. I am not trying to feel sorry for myself, I just think that writing them out will help make me more accountable in my attempt to change them from here on out. I’ve made a lot of questionable decisions monetary wise and I’ve finally started to calm the fuck down about it. Having what seemed like financial freedom lead to a frantic craze of consumption. And suddenly I found myself asking my parents for money. Then it really hit me. I’ve got to stop this madness. It’s a slow process, but I’ve started budgeting, with an initial thousand-dollar monthly budget, I am going to be much more conscious of what I spend money on and make more rationale decisions instead of impulse buying.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Moving on to my lack of attention to detail. I am still not sure how to fix it. Double check my work, triple check my work, or “just give a fuck” says my supervisor. This flaw seems much harder to fix currently as I haven’t hit a rock bottom yet. That’s a scary thought, at least with my crazed consumption I didn’t notice until the last second, but now that I am aware of my downward spiral, I am freaking out a little and it’s going to keep spiralling down until I find a way to crawl myself back up. This will be my focus next week.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; And that’s a wrap on this chapter of my life.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Note to self: work on transitions and conclusions… till next time!</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post1" id="post1"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post1">Consistency and Appreciation</a></h2><p>"Drudge through the drudgery"</p></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 25 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;Its only my fourth post and I am starting to realize my initial excitement about blogging has drastically decreased. At first it seemed fun to be able to write out my life for other people to see, but now it just seems like a pain in the ass. That doesn’t mean I am going to stop.

Sure we have talents and we enjoy doing things we are good at, but that doesn’t necessarily mean those things are our passions. I’ve learned one should not spend time “pursuing” their passions but rather spend time “cultivating” them. I first heard this idea from a podcast from the minimalists (I highly recommend you give it a listen) and the idea really stuck with me. So I’ve decided I am going to drudge through the drudgery and cultivate my passion for blogging. I really can’t say I am certain this is going to be a passion but I can definitely see myself blogging for a long period of time into the future.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I’ve learned a lot in the past week. Now that may seem like a loaded sentence so I’m just going to go right ahead and let all my thoughts out here</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Two weeks ago I really disliked my job, my co workers and bosses can be real assholes sometimes. They are hard-asses when I fuck up and don’t show appreciation when a job is done well. However, things really turned out for me last week. My hard-ass co-worker started a sentence with “I know I can be a hard-ass about things but…” and that really got to me. It seemed that he was aware of his actions and he was making a conscious effort to improve himself. This really changed my perspective about him and the work place positively and it really pushed me to be aware of my own actions at work. Today he even complimented me on a job I finished! I guess there’s a first time for everything eh? Now I got into wanting to help out, wanting to do my best and wanting to prove to them that I am capable of meeting their expectations and that of my own.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Appreciation. I’ve always gotten into fights with my mom as a child, but as I grew older we started to see eye to eye on a lot more things and these fights stopped. I’ve learned to listen to my parents realizing they were very reasonable with their actions towards me and that I am a pretty spoiled kid. However, listening to my parents and appreciating them I learned were two completely different worlds. Last weekend I had a crazy rental situation going on and a thousand-dollar plane ticket to Thailand I had to purchase. With a 29-day month and a crazy work week I didn’t give any of this any thought. So when Friday came I panicked and wasn’t sure if I had enough money to do everything, so I asked my parents to borrow some money. We had a small chat and in the end I sent them a text with a break how much money I wanted, and they sent it to my instantly, and they send me 1.5 times what I asked for. What happened next was surprising. I sat down for a minute and suddenly I just started crying, I didn’t ball my eyes out or anything, but the fact they just sent me a thousand dollars and just told me to learn from my mistakes just overwhelmed me. My parents do so much for me and yet I’ve done nothing for them. Sure I take them out for dinner when I go home, but I barely make time for them. All I wanted to do was to go out and party with my buddies. I’m a shitty kid and yet my parents still do all this for me without asking for anything in return. That’s a lot to take in without feeling guilty. Its easy to say “im gonna appreciate my parents so much more now!” but when I really thought about it, it wasn’t that easy. I’m going to seriously think about how I am going to show my parents how much I appreciate them and I think one would be to really work hard on my study habits and let them be proud of their own kid.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post2" id="post2"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post2">The world is unfair… and overwhelming</a></h2><p>“Life itself is simple...it's just not easy.”</p></div><div class="meta"><h1 class="ribbon"><strong class="ribbon-content">Feb 21, 2016</strong></h1></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;So I’m 20 years old, and I want to do everything. I recently bought a camera but haven’t been diligently learning about photography. I really want to get into to it but it the truth is I’ve just been lazy and kept finding excuses avoiding it. However, I am going to make a commitment and as soon as I finish this blog, I will dedicate at least a thirty productive minutes into learning about photography and my camera.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post2text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading</button><div id="post2text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;On another note, I want to learn about philosophy. I want to read more books, fiction or non-fiction, I want to have more intricate workouts but it just doesn’t seem like I have time to do all this. Maybe I’ll sleep less. The idea of getting up an hour earlier seemed to really stick in my head. I think I will give it a try next week and hope I don’t get too tired and get sick again. My goal is to get up in the morning every day and read for an hour, maybe half an hour to start. Baby steps right?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; And now to finally relate back to the title of this blog, work sucks. Or in other works, I suck at work. I suck at job so it seems and it’s really hard for me to accept that. I guess self-pity has been more apparent this term than others. I’ve always used the excuse of “never having an office” to make myself feel better about my struggles at work but the truth is I’ve never had an office job before and this is really fucking hard. My boss tells me I’m walking a very fine line between a good review and a bad review and that I need to give a fuck about what I’m doing. The goal I’ve decided to set for myself for the next couple of months is not give a fuck about what I’m doing but to find the motivation to do it. At this point in of my life jobs are about experiences and mostly a means for me to earn money to full my hobbies in life. I was going to write “passions” but I don’t think I’ve put in the blood, sweat and tears to call it that yet. I want to give a fuck about what I’m doing but currently I just feel stuck, I don’t feel like what I’m doing is important enough for me to give a fuck, sure lets “put a dollar sign” beside every single word I type out at work, but none of this is my responsibility in the end. So if I fuck up, someone else takes the blame and then they come at me and give me shit. I would rather I get the criticism straight up and not have to play a game of telephone for it. But the world is unfair; I mean the other co-op who sits beside me is “outstanding”. I am jealous and I feel resentment, not towards her but towards my superiors. We had one falling out and we agreed that “shit happens”. I’ve moved on from it, and I really hope you guys have moved on from it too and if distancing yourselves from me is how you’re going to deal with it then that’s just how it is.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Everyone think they have a plan, until they get punched in the face. That’s what the poster on my bedroom wall at school says. Mike Tyson said it, says the poster. And I feel like I’ve been constantly getting punched in the face for the past two weeks. But the other quote goes something like it doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down as long as you stand back. Right? That’s what I am going to do and that’s something I have to prove to nobody but myself. If you don’t like me fine, if you don’t like the way I talk fine, but I am going to work hard and find that motivation to give a fuck and make you want to have me back for another coop. Words are easily said. Now I just have to put them into action.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I am little nervous for work tomorrow, but that’s a learning experience. If I am not comfortable than I am growing. No matter how tough life gets, you just have to be even tougher to get through it.</p></div><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post3" id="post3"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post3">Second Blog!

Just reading the first couple lines of my last blog was enough to make me cringe at how bad my attention to detail is… and also my writing… and also the fact that I’m reading my own blog.</p><p></p>&emsp;&emsp; Well, what’s done is done. I will cringe and move on and proofread. On the Brightside, it’ll definitely help me in improving my writing, but it’ll also help me learn to accept myself. As easy as it sounds, it’s pretty fucking hard to come to terms with everything in my life. Denial is pretty easy I’ve learned, but life isn’t supposed to be easy…<button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post3text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading</button><div id="post3text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;My thought process in this blog has been going all over the place, let’s try and refocus. Another week has passed. Spent the weekend drinking and eating junk food, what a great weekend! As sarcastically as it may sound I definitely enjoyed the weekend. I mean, I made new friends; it’s been a good while since that’s happened and it was definitely an experience. These guys are pretty cool, they’re the typical dudes you would expect to meet in college, and it was nice being around them compared to my friends for a change.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;The weekend did take a toll on me though, mentally and physically. I know it’s nice to relax and enjoy myself on the weekend, but looking back and knowing how much I’ve set myself back from all the meal prepping and working out I’ve put in kinda sucks. We learn from our mistakes right? So verdict is: I won’t drink as much this weekend. I mean it’s only Monday, so we’ll see how long that statement will actually hold up… at least till Saturday I’m hoping…</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Work got hella busy today. I don’t know how it happened, but it did. As a result, people get stressed, their moods worsen and they get bitchier and harder to deal with. I mean, same goes to me, but I think I’ve got a decent handle on my emotions. I don’t like to confront people but my biggest pet peeve is when people argue with a close mind. I can say I am definitely a victim to it. No one likes to admit their wrong, especially when it comes to face with someone who seems inferior to you whether it’d be in the work place or in your personal life. It’s hard to deal with; I just have to be the bigger man. This week will definitely be a test of it and I will consciously make an effort to do it!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;It’ll be easier knowing a good weekend in coming up. Shrooms! Yay! Drugs! Bill’s first time, I’m excited for him… and nervous, I hope his trip goes well and he doesn’t end up dwelling on his girl problems, but then again, I hope my trip goes well and I don’t end up dwelling on my life problems…which seems to happen every time I do. Oh well, it’ll be good. Then Deadpool with the boys after. Exciting stuff to look forward to!</p></div><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post4" id="post4"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post4">Blog #1: A Typical Sunday Night</a></h2><p>I'M LISTENING TO THE TYPE OF MUSIC HE DOESN'T LIKE</p></div><div class="meta"><h1 class="ribbon"><strong class="ribbon-content">Jan 31, 2016</strong></h1></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;Ok here goes… My first blog post! This is both exciting and nerve racking for me. It still feels weird writing out my life events and feeling to an internet output where almost anyone in the world can find it. And yet here I am, sitting in front of computer about to tell the world the most recent events that have occurred in my life.</p><p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post4text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading</button><div id="post4text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Well it’s a pretty normal Sunday night for, I’m tired as fuck, woke on a bed that wasn’t my own, bussed back to my apartment just to frantically eat a meal and pack up to my gym clothes to go for an intense training session with Slavik. I don’t know what really sold me on the idea of a personal trainer, and I didn’t know what to expect coming into it, but you know, I’ve paid 700$ so I better be working my ass off for this.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Training is tough. I go to the gym regularly, but now I’ve finally learned what it feels to be pushed to the limit. We focused on arms today. After a superset of chin ups and isolated curled my arms were pumped I couldn’t hold them out straight. It was a good pain, so I tell myself. We will have to see how this progress, 10 more sessions to go!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Eating is tougher. Was that grammatically phrased properly? I guess I don’t care much about grammar at this point. But anyways, back on track, 2500 calories a day. I’ve even bought a scale, and to my surprised I use it fairly regularly. Ok I don’t measure out every single meal, but I think I do a good estimate of my portions, so we might end up a couple hundred calories off, it’s a learning process right? Only time will tell.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Wow… Waow, I’ve written a lot for my first blog. Honestly I thought I could write forever if I wanted to get everything out in this single blog, but let’s keep it simple, simpler I should say. Life is good right now; I’ve been spending a lot, carelessly as I’ve come to notice. That’s a problem I need to fix…slowly. It’s nice to go out and enjoy a great sushi dinner, I mean we ate sea urchin (I still don’t know what is it, but it was amazing) but when you get a 120$, it hurts a little. I like the idea of not putting a price of food, but I think I’ll have to apply that idea only once in a while.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I think that’s enough for my first blog, I have work tomorrow, hopefully I’ll have a better idea of what I’m doing, realistically, that’s probably not going to happen. Going to get started on the third Robert Langdon book. I am really glad I’ve done some reading this term, but that’s a wrap everybody! See you next time!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Hopefully I’ll be able to update this regularly, although no one is going to read it, and hopefully I won’t be needing to update this every single day… But like I said early, only time will tell.</p></div><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></p></article><!-- Pagination --><ul class="actions pagination"><li><a href="" class="disabled button big previous pagination-button">Previous Page</a></li><li><a href="#" class="button big next pagination-button">Next Page</a></li></ul></div></div><!-- Scripts --><script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/skel.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/util.js"></script><!--[if lte IE 8]><script src="assets/js/ie/respond.min.js"></script><![endif]--><script src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
