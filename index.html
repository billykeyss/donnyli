He is a really fucking successful businessman, so why not try to implement some of his ideas into my life? One of his daily habits was writing, blogging specifically. Sure one could journal, but then its very easy to hide things, to privatize your thoughts. However, his argument pro blogging was that it will forever be there, for other people to see. So now whenever I say something, people can call me out on it and its there. Written in stone. (Written in data more like…) I really like this idea. Not only does this coincide with my value of being an open person, it also allows me to be more accountable with everything in my life.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post8text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post8text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;So now I am going to provide daily blogs which hopefully contains just a little bit of insight towards my life and the things I learn everyday.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Firstly, small rant, work today suck. My co workers are douche bags. If you are going to call me out for scrolling through the internet in front of the whole contracting team (only 3 people… LOL) that’s fine. It was my bad, I shouldn’t have been slacking off during work. BUT if you’re always on reddit and facebook and stay late because your day wasn’t productive, I hope your conscious sits well for calling me out today.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Moving on, I recently also listened to an interview with Charles Poliquin (considered one of the best strength coaches in the world! No exaggeration) and he said something that really stuck with me: “we either make choices out of fear or out of love”. I always believed that the world wasn’t black and white but more a colour spectrum. You now there’s mild, medium, spicy, really spicy, brown people spicy (HAHA I just couldn’t stop myself there). After this quote, I think my outlook on the world has been dented and if you really think about it, if we break down out our own choices is there really anything we chose that is in-between fear or love? I go to the gym because I love working out and seeing results, I study because I fear the idea of failing, I don’t ask the cute girl sitting next to me out to coffee because I fear the idea of getting rejected?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I think becoming aware of this we can really change the way we think. Instead of not asking her out fearing rejection, one could think of this as I’d love to ask her out because I love the idea of meeting new people. Doesn’t that seem like a much better way to approach things? I am going to end this blog on this note: we should all make decisions based out of love and not fear. This will lead to a much more fulfilling life.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><article class="post" name="post7" id="post7"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post7">Distractions</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 20 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; Ultra is streaming, although I can’t say I am a fan of watching a stream of live raves but PENDULUM AND KNIFE PARTY. That is fucking awesome. However, I am also trying to update this blog and this stream is really (REALLY) distracting.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post7text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post7text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;There was a point when I was tripping on shrooms that I just wanted just felt so overwhelmed by all the stimulus around me and I just wanted to turn everything off and relax. Now that I’m not on shrooms I find myself always wanting to do something, to listen to music, to watch a TV show, read an article, just something to fill my time. Oh the irony of life. Why is it that we have to find ourselves being distracted by something all the time? I think its because life is stressful and these distractions offer us escape, denial from our current realities of life. But they don’t last forever so why not just face it head on?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; It’s been a slow week, so I guess this post will just focus on a couple thoughts I’ve had about life. I used to have a lot of free time on my hands, I would just get baked, play league or watch some TV. That was a terrible time in my life, and sadly that was life a couple months ago. I’m not saying I don’t do it anymore, it’s fun and relaxing but now I am much more deliberate about it. Planning out a Friday night after 8pm to get baked and play some videos isn’t as bad as getting home and doing it right away, I mean it’s a Friday night?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Another point I wanted to make about this was that where the fuck did all my free time go? I didn’t do shit last school term and now I barely have time to finish a 40min TV show or to do everything I want to do. I guess that’s very naïve of me to say that. I may I have less time now, but I can definitely prioritize and get the things I really wanted to do done. But being productive is really hard. I mean I can barely write this blog without alt-tabbing to the ultra stream… (this set is hella good though).</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Living by myself, I’ve suddenly developed all these interests: strength training, reading, photography and blogging, and I know I can’t develop all of these interests at the same time, but the 20-year-old of me thinks I can. I mean, when we are 20 we are on top of the world right? I find myself trying sometimes, and suddenly I just feel overwhelmed and end up watching TV… Productivity in a nut shell, right? Right?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I really need to working on buckling down and learning to be self-disciplined. This week I am going to take one baby step towards that and say I am going to enjoy finishing The Power of Habits (the book I am currently reading) by 9pm on Sunday night. Hopefully, I’ll be able to steal one of my friend’s books to read after while I await the arrival of April or order my new batch of books!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Alright… back to ultra…</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post6" id="post6"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post6">Perspective</a></h2><p>“Compliance will get you through the day, but only engagement will get you through the night”</p></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 14 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp; When you’ve only written five blog posts and your friend texts you about the sixth one you’ve been pushing off. That’s a good feeling. I’ve been reading a book called “Drive” by Daniel Pinkman which takes a new perspective on what really motivates us and a lot of it has been centered around accountability and autonomy. Our own willingness to get a job done and a job done well. With that thought in mind, knowing you have friends to keep you accountable for your passions and goals in life really does motivate you to better yourself in every aspect..</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post6text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post6text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;I’m currently half way through the book and a quote I found that really hit me went something like this: “compliance will get you through the day, but only engagement will get you through the night” I think this quote really sums up what I’ve got from this book and puts one’s view on life into perspective.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Wow when I re-read my own shitty explanation of such a meaningful quote, I now fully understand why I got such terrible marks in my English essays… that and my terrible (but improving) grammar…</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Anyways! I spent the weekend in Kingston. To break it down, I spent the weekend drinking, eating and sleeping at a 70/20/10 ratio I would say. I drank a lot… and I definitely paid for it by nothing getting any done yesterday or today. On my bus ride back to Toronto, I really thought about how unproductive I was that weekend and how much work could have been done and I really did feel regretful. However, after a long and not-so-busy work day, I came to realize how much fun I had too. We just have to fully engage ourselves in the moment, whether it might be work or getting that last shot in in beer pong. Real life is hard, it’s stressful and I have learned that turning off is not an option, but rather we just have to focus on one thing at a time and so what if that’s a whole weekend. I mean 72 hours seems like a lot, but that’s also only 0.008th of a year. So it’s all about putting things into perspective and trying to get the most out of each moment. I’ve come to realize that not all these moments are going to be good moments, but I’ve also come to realize that if you fully engage yourself into what you do, you will always come out a little better before, I mean what is there really motivation that’s better than self-improvement?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; P.S. My original title was “the little things” but seeing how much I used the word “perspective” I might as well right?</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post5" id="post5"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post5">Reflection</a></h2></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 6 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;Another week has ended and here I am again. Not sure where to start for this blog, so lets just write and see where I end up.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post5text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post5text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Shrooms! Every time I do them, a mere six-hour trip seems like a whole other lifetime to me. These drugs really make lose a sense of time. I stare at a clock, I realize what time it is, then the clock starts swirling and a billion other thoughts explode into my head. Next thing you know, I decide to stare at the clock again, I see the numbers in front of me but the amount of time that’s passed by doesn’t register. A billion more thoughts rush back into my head and I looked up to see that I am in a room full of paintings. Surprise! Personally, shrooms really amplify everything around me, whether I am more aware or I am imaging myself to be more aware I notice myself thinking about everything. I pick up on the conversations around me, people’s facial features, people’s tones and even their body language. It’s a weird thought. Also everything moves around me, literally everything. So maybe its just my confused sense that putting all these thoughts in my head and I am not really picking up on anything around me. I mean I forgot about the concept of eating for a whole 4 hours. I saw my friends getting a crepe and they even fed me a bite, but none of that registered. Everything I saw just seemed like a car driving past me, you watched it come in view, observed the details of the car during the moments it resided in front of you and then watched it drive away without ever giving it a second though. What a drug eh?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; With that being said, the lack of sense of time really likes you ponder everything in your life, every small detail from existentialism thoughts to “wow how cool is that painting in front of me?”. Its reflection in a sense, and reflecting back on the last months of this co-op term I’ve really be made aware of my own flaws more than anything else. My lack of self-control, lack of focus, lack of attention to detail and shitty work ethic. I am not trying to feel sorry for myself, I just think that writing them out will help make me more accountable in my attempt to change them from here on out. I’ve made a lot of questionable decisions monetary wise and I’ve finally started to calm the fuck down about it. Having what seemed like financial freedom lead to a frantic craze of consumption. And suddenly I found myself asking my parents for money. Then it really hit me. I’ve got to stop this madness. It’s a slow process, but I’ve started budgeting, with an initial thousand-dollar monthly budget, I am going to be much more conscious of what I spend money on and make more rationale decisions instead of impulse buying.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Moving on to my lack of attention to detail. I am still not sure how to fix it. Double check my work, triple check my work, or “just give a fuck” says my supervisor. This flaw seems much harder to fix currently as I haven’t hit a rock bottom yet. That’s a scary thought, at least with my crazed consumption I didn’t notice until the last second, but now that I am aware of my downward spiral, I am freaking out a little and it’s going to keep spiralling down until I find a way to crawl myself back up. This will be my focus next week.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; And that’s a wrap on this chapter of my life.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Note to self: work on transitions and conclusions… till next time!</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post1" id="post1"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post1">Consistency and Appreciation</a></h2><p>"Drudge through the drudgery"</p></div><div class="meta"><h3>March 25 2016</h3></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;Its only my fourth post and I am starting to realize my initial excitement about blogging has drastically decreased. At first it seemed fun to be able to write out my life for other people to see, but now it just seems like a pain in the ass. That doesn’t mean I am going to stop. I just have to “drudge through the drudgery” (A quote from the minimalist) and eventually reach the other side!</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post1text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading....</button><div id="post1text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;One thing I’ve learned in the last couple of weeks of working, hanging out with friends and spending time to myself is that we don’t really had passions. Sure we have talents and we enjoy doing things we are good at, but that doesn’t necessarily mean those things are our passions. I’ve learned one should not spend time “pursuing” their passions but rather spend time “cultivating” them. I first heard this idea from a podcast from the minimalists (I highly recommend you give it a listen) and the idea really stuck with me. So I’ve decided I am going to drudge through the drudgery and cultivate my passion for blogging. I really can’t say I am certain this is going to be a passion but I can definitely see myself blogging for a long period of time into the future.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I’ve learned a lot in the past week. Now that may seem like a loaded sentence so I’m just going to go right ahead and let all my thoughts out here</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Two weeks ago I really disliked my job, my co workers and bosses can be real assholes sometimes. They are hard-asses when I fuck up and don’t show appreciation when a job is done well. However, things really turned out for me last week. My hard-ass co-worker started a sentence with “I know I can be a hard-ass about things but…” and that really got to me. It seemed that he was aware of his actions and he was making a conscious effort to improve himself. This really changed my perspective about him and the work place positively and it really pushed me to be aware of my own actions at work. Today he even complimented me on a job I finished! I guess there’s a first time for everything eh? Now I got into wanting to help out, wanting to do my best and wanting to prove to them that I am capable of meeting their expectations and that of my own.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Appreciation. I’ve always gotten into fights with my mom as a child, but as I grew older we started to see eye to eye on a lot more things and these fights stopped. I’ve learned to listen to my parents realizing they were very reasonable with their actions towards me and that I am a pretty spoiled kid. However, listening to my parents and appreciating them I learned were two completely different worlds. Last weekend I had a crazy rental situation going on and a thousand-dollar plane ticket to Thailand I had to purchase. With a 29-day month and a crazy work week I didn’t give any of this any thought. So when Friday came I panicked and wasn’t sure if I had enough money to do everything, so I asked my parents to borrow some money. We had a small chat and in the end I sent them a text with a break how much money I wanted, and they sent it to my instantly, and they send me 1.5 times what I asked for. What happened next was surprising. I sat down for a minute and suddenly I just started crying, I didn’t ball my eyes out or anything, but the fact they just sent me a thousand dollars and just told me to learn from my mistakes just overwhelmed me. My parents do so much for me and yet I’ve done nothing for them. Sure I take them out for dinner when I go home, but I barely make time for them. All I wanted to do was to go out and party with my buddies. I’m a shitty kid and yet my parents still do all this for me without asking for anything in return. That’s a lot to take in without feeling guilty. Its easy to say “im gonna appreciate my parents so much more now!” but when I really thought about it, it wasn’t that easy. I’m going to seriously think about how I am going to show my parents how much I appreciate them and I think one would be to really work hard on my study habits and let them be proud of their own kid.</p></div><hr><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post2" id="post2"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post2">The world is unfair… and overwhelming</a></h2><p>“Life itself is simple...it's just not easy.”</p></div><div class="meta"><h1 class="ribbon"><strong class="ribbon-content">Feb 21, 2016</strong></h1></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;So I’m 20 years old, and I want to do everything. I recently bought a camera but haven’t been diligently learning about photography. I really want to get into to it but it the truth is I’ve just been lazy and kept finding excuses avoiding it. However, I am going to make a commitment and as soon as I finish this blog, I will dedicate at least a thirty productive minutes into learning about photography and my camera.</p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post2text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading</button><div id="post2text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;On another note, I want to learn about philosophy. I want to read more books, fiction or non-fiction, I want to have more intricate workouts but it just doesn’t seem like I have time to do all this. Maybe I’ll sleep less. The idea of getting up an hour earlier seemed to really stick in my head. I think I will give it a try next week and hope I don’t get too tired and get sick again. My goal is to get up in the morning every day and read for an hour, maybe half an hour to start. Baby steps right?</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; And now to finally relate back to the title of this blog, work sucks. Or in other works, I suck at work. I suck at job so it seems and it’s really hard for me to accept that. I guess self-pity has been more apparent this term than others. I’ve always used the excuse of “never having an office” to make myself feel better about my struggles at work but the truth is I’ve never had an office job before and this is really fucking hard. My boss tells me I’m walking a very fine line between a good review and a bad review and that I need to give a fuck about what I’m doing. The goal I’ve decided to set for myself for the next couple of months is not give a fuck about what I’m doing but to find the motivation to do it. At this point in of my life jobs are about experiences and mostly a means for me to earn money to full my hobbies in life. I was going to write “passions” but I don’t think I’ve put in the blood, sweat and tears to call it that yet. I want to give a fuck about what I’m doing but currently I just feel stuck, I don’t feel like what I’m doing is important enough for me to give a fuck, sure lets “put a dollar sign” beside every single word I type out at work, but none of this is my responsibility in the end. So if I fuck up, someone else takes the blame and then they come at me and give me shit. I would rather I get the criticism straight up and not have to play a game of telephone for it. But the world is unfair; I mean the other co-op who sits beside me is “outstanding”. I am jealous and I feel resentment, not towards her but towards my superiors. We had one falling out and we agreed that “shit happens”. I’ve moved on from it, and I really hope you guys have moved on from it too and if distancing yourselves from me is how you’re going to deal with it then that’s just how it is.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Everyone think they have a plan, until they get punched in the face. That’s what the poster on my bedroom wall at school says. Mike Tyson said it, says the poster. And I feel like I’ve been constantly getting punched in the face for the past two weeks. But the other quote goes something like it doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down as long as you stand back. Right? That’s what I am going to do and that’s something I have to prove to nobody but myself. If you don’t like me fine, if you don’t like the way I talk fine, but I am going to work hard and find that motivation to give a fuck and make you want to have me back for another coop. Words are easily said. Now I just have to put them into action.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I am little nervous for work tomorrow, but that’s a learning experience. If I am not comfortable than I am growing. No matter how tough life gets, you just have to be even tougher to get through it.</p></div><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post3" id="post3"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post3">Second Blog!

I will cringe and move on and proofread. On the Brightside, it’ll definitely help me in improving my writing, but it’ll also help me learn to accept myself. As easy as it sounds, it’s pretty fucking hard to come to terms with everything in my life. Denial is pretty easy I’ve learned, but life isn’t supposed to be easy…<button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post3text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading</button><div id="post3text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;My thought process in this blog has been going all over the place, let’s try and refocus. Another week has passed. Spent the weekend drinking and eating junk food, what a great weekend! As sarcastically as it may sound I definitely enjoyed the weekend. I mean, I made new friends; it’s been a good while since that’s happened and it was definitely an experience. These guys are pretty cool, they’re the typical dudes you would expect to meet in college, and it was nice being around them compared to my friends for a change.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;The weekend did take a toll on me though, mentally and physically. I know it’s nice to relax and enjoy myself on the weekend, but looking back and knowing how much I’ve set myself back from all the meal prepping and working out I’ve put in kinda sucks. We learn from our mistakes right? So verdict is: I won’t drink as much this weekend. I mean it’s only Monday, so we’ll see how long that statement will actually hold up… at least till Saturday I’m hoping…</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Work got hella busy today. I don’t know how it happened, but it did. As a result, people get stressed, their moods worsen and they get bitchier and harder to deal with. I mean, same goes to me, but I think I’ve got a decent handle on my emotions. I don’t like to confront people but my biggest pet peeve is when people argue with a close mind. I can say I am definitely a victim to it. No one likes to admit their wrong, especially when it comes to face with someone who seems inferior to you whether it’d be in the work place or in your personal life. It’s hard to deal with; I just have to be the bigger man. This week will definitely be a test of it and I will consciously make an effort to do it!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;It’ll be easier knowing a good weekend in coming up. Shrooms! Yay! Drugs! Bill’s first time, I’m excited for him… and nervous, I hope his trip goes well and he doesn’t end up dwelling on his girl problems, but then again, I hope my trip goes well and I don’t end up dwelling on my life problems…which seems to happen every time I do. Oh well, it’ll be good. Then Deadpool with the boys after. Exciting stuff to look forward to!</p></div><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></article><!-- Post --><article class="post" name="post4" id="post4"><header><div class="title"><h2><a href="#post4">Blog #1: A Typical Sunday Night</a></h2><p>I'M LISTENING TO THE TYPE OF MUSIC HE DOESN'T LIKE</p></div><div class="meta"><h1 class="ribbon"><strong class="ribbon-content">Jan 31, 2016</strong></h1></div></header><p>&emsp;&emsp;Ok here goes… My first blog post! This is both exciting and nerve racking for me. It still feels weird writing out my life events and feeling to an internet output where almost anyone in the world can find it. And yet here I am, sitting in front of computer about to tell the world the most recent events that have occurred in my life.</p><p><button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post4text" onclick="setInput(this)">Continue Reading</button><div id="post4text" class="collapse"><p>&emsp;&emsp;Well it’s a pretty normal Sunday night for, I’m tired as fuck, woke on a bed that wasn’t my own, bussed back to my apartment just to frantically eat a meal and pack up to my gym clothes to go for an intense training session with Slavik. I don’t know what really sold me on the idea of a personal trainer, and I didn’t know what to expect coming into it, but you know, I’ve paid 700$ so I better be working my ass off for this.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Training is tough. I go to the gym regularly, but now I’ve finally learned what it feels to be pushed to the limit. We focused on arms today. After a superset of chin ups and isolated curled my arms were pumped I couldn’t hold them out straight. It was a good pain, so I tell myself. We will have to see how this progress, 10 more sessions to go!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Eating is tougher. Was that grammatically phrased properly? I guess I don’t care much about grammar at this point. But anyways, back on track, 2500 calories a day. I’ve even bought a scale, and to my surprised I use it fairly regularly. Ok I don’t measure out every single meal, but I think I do a good estimate of my portions, so we might end up a couple hundred calories off, it’s a learning process right? Only time will tell.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp;Wow… Waow, I’ve written a lot for my first blog. Honestly I thought I could write forever if I wanted to get everything out in this single blog, but let’s keep it simple, simpler I should say. Life is good right now; I’ve been spending a lot, carelessly as I’ve come to notice. That’s a problem I need to fix…slowly. It’s nice to go out and enjoy a great sushi dinner, I mean we ate sea urchin (I still don’t know what is it, but it was amazing) but when you get a 120$, it hurts a little. I like the idea of not putting a price of food, but I think I’ll have to apply that idea only once in a while.</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; I think that’s enough for my first blog, I have work tomorrow, hopefully I’ll have a better idea of what I’m doing, realistically, that’s probably not going to happen. Going to get started on the third Robert Langdon book. I am really glad I’ve done some reading this term, but that’s a wrap everybody! See you next time!</p><p>&emsp;&emsp; Hopefully I’ll be able to update this regularly, although no one is going to read it, and hopefully I won’t be needing to update this every single day… But like I said early, only time will tell.</p></div><footer><ul class="stats"><li><a>Thoughts</a></li></ul></footer></p></article><!-- Pagination --><ul class="actions pagination"><li><a href="" class="disabled button big previous pagination-button">Previous Page</a></li><li><a href="#" class="button big next pagination-button">Next Page</a></li></ul></div></div><!-- Scripts --><script src="assets/js/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/skel.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/util.js"></script><!--[if lte IE 8]><script src="assets/js/ie/respond.min.js"></script><![endif]--><script src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
