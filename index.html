                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Its only my fourth post and I am starting to realize my initial excitement about blogging has drastically decreased. At first it seemed fun to be able to write out my life for other people to see, but now it just seems like a pain in the ass. That doesn’t mean I am going to stop. I just have to “drudge through the drudgery” (A quote from the minimalist) and eventually reach the other side! </p>

                <button type="button" class="button big" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#post1text" onclick='setInput(this)'>Continue Reading....</button>
                <div id="post1text" class="collapse">
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;One thing I’ve learned in the last couple of weeks of working, hanging out with friends and spending time to myself is that we don’t really had passions. Sure we have talents and we enjoy doing things we are good at, but that doesn’t necessarily mean those things are our passions. I’ve learned one should not spend time “pursuing” their passions but rather spend time “cultivating” them. I first heard this idea from a podcast from the minimalists (I highly recommend you give it a listen) and the idea really stuck with me. So I’ve decided I am going to drudge through the drudgery and cultivate my passion for blogging. I really can’t say I am certain this is going to be a passion but I can definitely see myself blogging for a long period of time into the future.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp; I’ve learned a lot in the past week. Now that may seem like a loaded sentence so I’m just going to go right ahead and let all my thoughts out here </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp; Two weeks ago I really disliked my job, my co workers and bosses can be real assholes sometimes. They are hard-asses when I fuck up and don’t show appreciation when a job is done well. However, things really turned out for me last week. My hard-ass co-worker started a sentence with “I know I can be a hard-ass about things but…” and that really got to me. It seemed that he was aware of his actions and he was making a conscious effort to improve himself. This really changed my perspective about him and the work place positively and it really pushed me to be aware of my own actions at work. Today he even complimented me on a job I finished! I guess there’s a first time for everything eh? Now I got into wanting to help out, wanting to do my best and wanting to prove to them that I am capable of meeting their expectations and that of my own. </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp; Appreciation. I’ve always gotten into fights with my mom as a child, but as I grew older we started to see eye to eye on a lot more things and these fights stopped. I’ve learned to listen to my parents realizing they were very reasonable with their actions towards me and that I am a pretty spoiled kid. However, listening to my parents and appreciating them I learned were two completely different worlds. Last weekend I had a crazy rental situation going on and a thousand-dollar plane ticket to Thailand I had to purchase. With a 29-day month and a crazy work week I didn’t give any of this any thought. So when Friday came I panicked and wasn’t sure if I had enough money to do everything, so I asked my parents to borrow some money. We had a small chat and in the end I sent them a text with a break how much money I wanted, and they sent it to my instantly, and they send me 1.5 times what I asked for. What happened next was surprising. I sat down for a minute and suddenly I just started crying, I didn’t ball my eyes out or anything, but the fact they just sent me a thousand dollars and just told me to learn from my mistakes just overwhelmed me. My parents do so much for me and yet I’ve done nothing for them. Sure I take them out for dinner when I go home, but I barely make time for them. All I wanted to do was to go out and party with my buddies. I’m a shitty kid and yet my parents still do all this for me without asking for anything in return. That’s a lot to take in without feeling guilty. Its easy to say “im gonna appreciate my parents so much more now!” but when I really thought about it, it wasn’t that easy. I’m going to seriously think about how I am going to show my parents how much I appreciate them and I think one would be to really work hard on my study habits and let them be proud of their own kid.</p>

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;So I’m 20 years old, and I want to do everything. I recently bought a camera but haven’t been diligently learning about photography. I really want to get into to it but it the truth is I’ve just been lazy and kept finding excuses avoiding it. However, I am going to make a commitment and as soon as I finish this blog, I will dedicate at least a thirty productive minutes into learning about photography and my camera. </p>

                <div id="post2text" class="collapse">
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;On another note, I want to learn about philosophy. I want to read more books, fiction or non-fiction, I want to have more intricate workouts but it just doesn’t seem like I have time to do all this. Maybe I’ll sleep less. The idea of getting up an hour earlier seemed to really stick in my head. I think I will give it a try next week and hope I don’t get too tired and get sick again. My goal is to get up in the morning every day and read for an hour, maybe half an hour to start. Baby steps right? </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp; And now to finally relate back to the title of this blog, work sucks. Or in other works, I suck at work. I suck at job so it seems and it’s really hard for me to accept that. I guess self-pity has been more apparent this term than others. I’ve always used the excuse of “never having an office” to make myself feel better about my struggles at work but the truth is I’ve never had an office job before and this is really fucking hard. My boss tells me I’m walking a very fine line between a good review and a bad review and that I need to give a fuck about what I’m doing. The goal I’ve decided to set for myself for the next couple of months is not give a fuck about what I’m doing but to find the motivation to do it. At this point in of my life jobs are about experiences and mostly a means for me to earn money to full my hobbies in life. I was going to write “passions” but I don’t think I’ve put in the blood, sweat and tears to call it that yet. I want to give a fuck about what I’m doing but currently I just feel stuck, I don’t feel like what I’m doing is important enough for me to give a fuck, sure lets “put a dollar sign” beside every single word I type out at work, but none of this is my responsibility in the end. So if I fuck up, someone else takes the blame and then they come at me and give me shit. I would rather I get the criticism straight up and not have to play a game of telephone for it. But the world is unfair; I mean the other co-op who sits beside me is “outstanding”. I am jealous and I feel resentment, not towards her but towards my superiors. We had one falling out and we agreed that “shit happens”. I’ve moved on from it, and I really hope you guys have moved on from it too and if distancing yourselves from me is how you’re going to deal with it then that’s just how it is.
                    </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp; Everyone think they have a plan, until they get punched in the face. That’s what the poster on my bedroom wall at school says. Mike Tyson said it, says the poster. And I feel like I’ve been constantly getting punched in the face for the past two weeks. But the other quote goes something like it doesn’t matter how many times you get knocked down as long as you stand back. Right? That’s what I am going to do and that’s something I have to prove to nobody but myself. If you don’t like me fine, if you don’t like the way I talk fine, but I am going to work hard and find that motivation to give a fuck and make you want to have me back for another coop. Words are easily said. Now I just have to put them into action.
                    </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp; I am little nervous for work tomorrow, but that’s a learning experience. If I am not comfortable than I am growing. No matter how tough life gets, you just have to be even tougher to get through it.

                <p>&emsp;&emsp; Note to self: proof read. Just reading the first couple lines of my last blog was enough to make me cringe at how bad my attention to detail is… and also my writing… and also the fact that I’m reading my own blog.</p>
                <p>
                </p>&emsp;&emsp; Well, what’s done is done. I will cringe and move on and proofread. On the Brightside, it’ll definitely help me in improving my writing, but it’ll also help me learn to accept myself. As easy as it sounds, it’s pretty fucking hard to come to terms with everything in my life. Denial is pretty easy I’ve learned, but life isn’t supposed to be easy…</p>

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;My thought process in this blog has been going all over the place, let’s try and refocus. Another week has passed. Spent the weekend drinking and eating junk food, what a great weekend! As sarcastically as it may sound I definitely enjoyed the weekend. I mean, I made new friends; it’s been a good while since that’s happened and it was definitely an experience. These guys are pretty cool, they’re the typical dudes you would expect to meet in college, and it was nice being around them compared to my friends for a change.
                    </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;The weekend did take a toll on me though, mentally and physically. I know it’s nice to relax and enjoy myself on the weekend, but looking back and knowing how much I’ve set myself back from all the meal prepping and working out I’ve put in kinda sucks. We learn from our mistakes right? So verdict is: I won’t drink as much this weekend. I mean it’s only Monday, so we’ll see how long that statement will actually hold up… at least till Saturday I’m hoping…
                    </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Work got hella busy today. I don’t know how it happened, but it did. As a result, people get stressed, their moods worsen and they get bitchier and harder to deal with. I mean, same goes to me, but I think I’ve got a decent handle on my emotions. I don’t like to confront people but my biggest pet peeve is when people argue with a close mind. I can say I am definitely a victim to it. No one likes to admit their wrong, especially when it comes to face with someone who seems inferior to you whether it’d be in the work place or in your personal life. It’s hard to deal with; I just have to be the bigger man. This week will definitely be a test of it and I will consciously make an effort to do it!
                    </p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;It’ll be easier knowing a good weekend in coming up. Shrooms! Yay! Drugs! Bill’s first time, I’m excited for him… and nervous, I hope his trip goes well and he doesn’t end up dwelling on his girl problems, but then again, I hope my trip goes well and I don’t end up dwelling on my life problems…which seems to happen every time I do. Oh well, it’ll be good. Then Deadpool with the boys after. Exciting stuff to look forward to!

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Ok here goes… My first blog post! This is both exciting and nerve racking for me. It still feels weird writing out my life events and feeling to an internet output where almost anyone in the world can find it. And yet here I am, sitting in front of computer about to tell the world the most recent events that have occurred in my life. </p>

                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Well it’s a pretty normal Sunday night for, I’m tired as fuck, woke on a bed that wasn’t my own, bussed back to my apartment just to frantically eat a meal and pack up to my gym clothes to go for an intense training session with Slavik. I don’t know what really sold me on the idea of a personal trainer, and I didn’t know what to expect coming into it, but you know, I’ve paid 700$ so I better be working my ass off for this.
                        </p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Training is tough. I go to the gym regularly, but now I’ve finally learned what it feels to be pushed to the limit. We focused on arms today. After a superset of chin ups and isolated curled my arms were pumped I couldn’t hold them out straight. It was a good pain, so I tell myself. We will have to see how this progress, 10 more sessions to go!
                        </p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Eating is tougher. Was that grammatically phrased properly? I guess I don’t care much about grammar at this point. But anyways, back on track, 2500 calories a day. I’ve even bought a scale, and to my surprised I use it fairly regularly. Ok I don’t measure out every single meal, but I think I do a good estimate of my portions, so we might end up a couple hundred calories off, it’s a learning process right? Only time will tell.
                        </p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Wow… Waow, I’ve written a lot for my first blog. Honestly I thought I could write forever if I wanted to get everything out in this single blog, but let’s keep it simple, simpler I should say. Life is good right now; I’ve been spending a lot, carelessly as I’ve come to notice. That’s a problem I need to fix…slowly. It’s nice to go out and enjoy a great sushi dinner, I mean we ate sea urchin (I still don’t know what is it, but it was amazing) but when you get a 120$, it hurts a little. I like the idea of not putting a price of food, but I think I’ll have to apply that idea only once in a while.
                        </p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp; I think that’s enough for my first blog, I have work tomorrow, hopefully I’ll have a better idea of what I’m doing, realistically, that’s probably not going to happen. Going to get started on the third Robert Langdon book. I am really glad I’ve done some reading this term, but that’s a wrap everybody! See you next time!
                        </p>
                        <p>&emsp;&emsp; Hopefully I’ll be able to update this regularly, although no one is going to read it, and hopefully I won’t be needing to update this every single day… But like I said early, only time will tell.
